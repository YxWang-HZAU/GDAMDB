# GDAMDB
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the workflow of 
GDAMDB and NOT to implement it note to note and at the same time I will
 try not to miss out on the major bits discussed in the paper.
 For that matter, I'll be using the Flowers dataset.

The main work flow contain two parts.


## Extract mutation triples from pubmed articles





## data fusion based on GDAMDB module.
